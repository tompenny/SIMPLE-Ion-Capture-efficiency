# SIMPLE-Ion capture efficiency simulation

Code to model the polonium 212 ions Paul trap with a electrostatic attraction from a charged microsphere.
Solid angle calculation calculates the average solid angle covered by a detector outside the central cube for decays inside the cube.

Runs in Jupyter Notebook.
